# DSA Self-Preparation Log

This repo captures my journey through the complete Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) roadmap—starting from the basics and marching all the way to dynamic programming (DP). The goal is to learn each concept deeply, build supporting code samples, and track progress for interview readiness.

## 📚 What I’m Covering
| Stage | Focus | Targets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | Big-O analysis, space/time trade-offs, logical thinking | Understand what efficiency means and how to reason about it across problems |
| Data Structures | Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Tries, Hash Tables | Implement each DS, code core operations, and practice common interview patterns |
| Algorithms | Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Backtracking | Build reliable templates and identify when to apply each strategy |
| Advanced Topics | Greedy, Divide & Conquer, Graph traversals, Number theory bits | Learn variations that frequently appear in medium/large difficulty questions |
| Dynamic Programming (DP) | Memoization, Tabulation, State Optimization | Master building DP solutions from scratch and recognize overlapping subproblems |

## 🚀 Roadmap & Milestones
1. **Master fundamentals** – grind through base DS, implement operations in my preferred language, and note gotchas.
2. **Pattern practice** – solve problems grouped by recurring themes (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, tree traversal).
3. **Timelimit simulations** – mock timed sessions combining fresh problems and reviewing past mistakes.
4. **Deep dive into DP** – start with classic problems, document the state transitions, and build incrementally from recursion to optimized tabulation.

## 🔍 Study Workflow
- **Daily slot:** 1 hour of theory + 2 hours of problem-solving (leet code / custom). Split between warm-up reviews and new topics.
- **Notes:** Maintain a `notes/` folder (or dedicated files per topic) for formula sheets, tricky observations, and pseudocode templates.
- **Code samples:** Store working solutions in a structured manner (e.g., `arrays/`, `graphs/`, `dp/`), ensuring each has README comments explaining intent and complexity.
- **Reflection:** After each practice session, journal what went well, what confused me, and the next concept to revisit.

## 🧰 Resources I’m Using
- Books: *Grokking Algorithms*, *Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Elements of Programming Interviews*.
- Platforms: LeetCode (tag-based practice), AlgoExpert for worked examples, and YouTube breakdowns (Abdul Bari, back2back SWE) for tough concepts.
- Utilities: Visual tools (VisuAlgo, whiteboard software) for graph traversal demonstrations and DP state diagrams.

## 📈 Progress Tracker
| Date | Topic | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-02-07 | Baseline README + plan | ✅ | Captured roadmap, will iterate as I code |

Keep this README updated as I move through each concept so it doubles as both a study log and a ready-made reference for interviews.
